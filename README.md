# FPConcepts
This git repo is a discussion point for the [upcoming meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Elixir-CLE/events/228982780/) on Functional Concepts in Elixir.  

## WE COULD USE YOUR HELP! ##
We're trying a divide & conquer approach for this meetup with folks snagging a concept and chatting about it for about 10 +/- minutes with the group. If you'd like to help out, clone the repo, make a directory with the concept you'd like to tackle and put your notes/code/whatever in there.  

Thanks!

Some of the "Core Concepts" a quick community poll recommended were:  
* Functions as first class citizens
* Immutability
* Referential Transparency
* Pattern Matching
* map/reduce/filter
* recursion
* recursive processing of data structures
* Separation of pure functional code from code with side effects  

There may be more (and these probably need expansion) so please add/comment!
